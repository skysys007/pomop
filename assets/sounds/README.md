# Audio Files Placeholder

The audio files are currently placeholders. For a production deployment, you should:

## Option 1: Add Real Audio Files

Place MP3 or WAV files in this directory with these names:
- `bell.mp3` - Bell chime sound
- `chime.mp3` - Soft chime sound
- `gong.mp3` - Gong sound
- `ping.mp3` - Soft ping sound

## Option 2: Use Custom Upload

Users can upload their own audio files directly through the settings panel in the app.

## Free Audio Resources

- [Freesound.org](https://freesound.org) - Free sound effects
- [Zapsplat.com](https://www.zapsplat.com) - Free sound effects
- [Mixkit.co](https://mixkit.co/free-sound-effects/) - Free audio
- [Notification Sounds](https://notificationsounds.com/) - Alert sounds

## Note

The app will work without these files - users can upload their own sounds or the app will silently fail on audio playback (non-blocking).
